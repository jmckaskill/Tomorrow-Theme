# Tomorrow-night

I wanted a way to install the vim version of the Tomorrow theme using [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle), so I've forked it to reduce the code base to what is needed for that purpose.

Maybe there is a better way to do this, without having to fork and reduce the theme to a single variant. If there is and I find out how I will happily erradicate this fork.
